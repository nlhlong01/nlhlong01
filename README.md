### Hi there, I'm Long Nguyen ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for visiting my profile. Software engineering is fun and I am happy that we share this passion.

- ðŸŽ“ I am an ex-Autodesk software engineer intern working mostly with Front-end Web Development in Germany. I am going to graduate Master's on February 2021.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [**Machine Learning Playground**](https://github.com/nlhlong01/playground). Description: Although Machine Learning is a booming field, we are lacking good web-based applications for visualizing ML algorithms for education. One of the most prominent ones is the very cool Tensorflow's [playground for Deep Learning](https://playground.tensorflow.org/). I decided to fork it and build my own playground for several other ML algorithms I am fond of such as Decision Tree, Random Forest and SVM. If you are curious, check out the [deployed version](https://nlhlong01.github.io/playground).
